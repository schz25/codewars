# My Daily Codewars
Everyday is a new day to bring on a codewars kata!


![Codewars](https://github.r2v.ch/codewars?user=schz25&stroke=%23BB432C)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations

I usually will refactor code to make it more readable or to try a different approach on how to solve the challenge.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned so much from doing these daily challenges and one of the most important lessons it has taught me is to keep being consistent and even if the challenge seems very complex, breaking it down into smaller parts will help tackle it one step at a time.
